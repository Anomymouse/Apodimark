## Internal Documentation

This folder contains:
- an explanation of the design of Apodimark
- an exhaustive list of its differences with Commonmark
- a wish list of features and improvements

### Contribute

You can contribute in many ways:
- by identifying bugs or asking for improvements
- by tweaking the existing code to make it cleaner
- by adding missing documentation
- by adding new tests
- and of course by adding new features or fixing bugs

If you want to contribute, I recommend reading [design.md](design.md) to quickly understand how Apodimark works at a high level. Then you can look at the [wish list](wish-list.md) or the opened issues.

There is a target to help you quickly test your new changes: ApodimarkOutput. It provides some primitive output generation from the AST for testing purposes
