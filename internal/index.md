## Internal Documentation

This folder contains:
- an explanation of the design of Apodimark
- an exhaustive list of its differences with Commonmark

### Contribute

You can contribute in many ways:
- by fixing bugs or adding new features
- by identifying bugs or asking for improvements
- by tweaking the existing code to make it cleaner
- by adding missing documentation or new tests

You can look at the opened issues to quickly see how you can 
contribute to Apodimark.

If you want to add new features, I recommend reading [design.md](design.md) 
to quickly understand how Apodimark works at a high level.

There is a target to help you quickly test your new changes: ApodimarkOutput. 
It provides some primitive output generation from the AST for testing purposes.

If you have any question regarding the implementation, you can contact me at
